List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets

List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.


Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value

List Length
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function
